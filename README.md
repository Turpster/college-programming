# College Programming
This repository houses all programming tasks that have been given by my <b>AQA</b> Computer Science teacher, Darren. 
## Structure
Darren stores his Computer Science files in a OneDrive folder. For each folder Darren has gave the class to work on.

I will make C# Projects in a College Programming solution file with an addition of `Layout` which has abstract classes such as `Project`, `Paper` and `Task`  that are present throughout the projects and `Base` that includes the executor to run the projects.
## Running
1. You will need the [.NET Core 2.1 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1) installed to run the project
	* Please note that you will not be able to run this project without the .NET Core <b>2.1</b> SDK.
2. Open your *.csproj IDE such as [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) or the [Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).
3. Run the `Base` Project.
